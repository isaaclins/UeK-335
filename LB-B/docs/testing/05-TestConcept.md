## Test Methodology

### Testing Levels

1. **Unit Testing**:

   - Focus on testing individual components, services, and utility functions
   - Ensure business logic functions correctly in isolation

2. **Widget Testing (manual)**:

   - Test UI components in isolation
   - Verify rendering, layout, and user interactions
   - Test form validations and error handling

3. **Integration Testing (manual)**:

   - Test interaction between multiple components
   - Verify data flow between screens
   - Test navigation and state management

4. **System Testing (manual)**: 

   - End-to-end testing of complete user flows
   - Test app under realistic user scenarios
   - Verify all components work together correctly

### Testing Types

1. **Functional Testing**:

   - Verify all features work according to requirements
   - Test both positive and negative scenarios

2. **Performance Testing**:

   - Measure app startup time
   - Test responsiveness under load

3. **Usability Testing**:

   - Evaluate user experience with real users
   - Observe how users interact with the application
   - Collect feedback on UI/UX

4. **Compatibility Testing**:

   - Test on various device sizes and resolutions
   - Verify correct rendering on different screen densities

5. **Data Safety Testing**:

   - Verify data is correctly saved to device storage
   - Test data persistence across app restarts
   - Verify proper data cleanup when tasks are deleted
